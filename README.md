# beta-commodity-checker
An unfinished C++ backend application to correlate company stock prices &amp; balance sheet data with that company's commodity(s) prices.

For example:
XOM would correlate with WTI/Brent prices so it does that. It also does it with natural gas cuz it's more work not to.

### This source has a lot of types/defines that could've been replaced by 1 set in the API file. If you plan on using this I'd recommend globalizing the types

# This is old code! Uploading because a friend asked for it.
